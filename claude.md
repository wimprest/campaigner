### 3. Survey Nodes (MOST COMPLEX)
- **Multi-question surveys** with collapsible UI
- **4 question types**: Radio (single choice), Checkbox (multiple), Text input, Numeric range
- **Response paths** with dynamic output handles
- **Conditional routing** with 4 methods:
  1. **Simple mapping**: Map specific options to paths
  2. **Score-based logic**: Assign points to options, route by total score
  3. **Numeric range routing**: Route based on numeric values (‚â§, ‚â•, =, between) ‚≠ê NEW
  4. **Advanced AND/OR/NOT rules**: Complex multi-option logic

#### Score-Based System
- Each response option has a `points` value (can be negative)
- Survey calculates min/max possible score range
- Paths have `scoreMin` and `scoreMax` thresholds
- Visual indicators: üéØ badge on nodes with score routing

#### Numeric Range Routing ‚≠ê NEW
- For numeric range questions only
- **4 operators**:
  - `‚â§` Less than or equal to (single value)
  - `‚â•` Greater than or equal to (single value)
  - `=` Equal to (single value)
  - `between` Range with min/max values
- **Use case example**: Route based on document volume
  - Path 1: response ‚â§ 100
  - Path 2: response between 101-500
  - Path 3: response ‚â• 501
- Live preview shows formatted conditions (e.g., "‚úì 101 - 500 ‚Üí Path 1")
- Multiple conditions per path supported

#### Advanced Logic Rules
- **AND logic**: Require ALL selected options
- **OR logic**: Require ANY of selected options
- **NOT logic**: Exclude if certain options selected
- Visual indicators: üß† badge on nodes with advanced rules
- Priority: Advanced rules > Numeric range routing > Score routing > Simple mapping

## Development Patterns & Conventions

### State Management
- **Local component state** (useState) for UI interactions
- **React Flow hooks** (useNodesState, useEdgesState) for flowchart data
- **localStorage** for persistence (no backend/database)
- **No global state library** (Redux, Zustand, etc.) - keeping it simple

### Data Flow
1. User drags node from Sidebar ‚Üí `onDrop` in App.jsx
2. New node created with default data ‚Üí `getDefaultDataForType()`
3. User clicks node ‚Üí `onNodeClick` sets `selectedNode` state
4. ContentPanel renders with node data ‚Üí `renderNodeSpecificFields()`
5. User edits in ContentPanel ‚Üí local state (`localData`)
6. User clicks Save ‚Üí `onUpdate()` callback updates App.jsx state
7. React Flow automatically persists visual changes (position, connections)

### ID Generation
- Nodes: `node_${id++}` (simple incrementing counter)
- Questions: `q_${Date.now()}` (timestamp-based)
- Options: `q_${questionId}_opt_${Date.now()}` (prefixed with question ID)
- Paths: `path_${Date.now()}` (timestamp-based)

**Why timestamps?** Ensures uniqueness even when adding/removing items rapidly.

### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind utility classes** for 95% of styling
- **Inline styles** for dynamic colors (path colors, badges)
- **CSS modules**: None - all Tailwind or inline
- **Global CSS**: Only for ReactQuill (imported from node_modules)

### Error Handling
- **Minimal error boundaries** - relying on React defaults
- **Validation**: Mostly UI-level (required fields, number inputs)
- **User feedback**: `alert()` for save confirmations (TODO: replace with toast notifications)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Issues
1. ~~**Vite EBUSY warnings** on Windows/Dropbox~~ - **FIXED** (v0.2.1): Cache moved to system temp directory
2. **No toast notifications** - using browser `alert()` (works but not polished)
3. **No undo/redo** - users must manually save versions
4. **No collaborative editing** - single user, localStorage only

### Technical Debt
1. **ContentPanel.jsx is too large** (~1500 lines) - should split into sub-components
2. **No TypeScript** - would help catch data structure errors
3. **Limited accessibility** - keyboard navigation not fully implemented
4. **No unit tests** - relying on manual testing
5. **Alert() for user feedback** - should replace with toast notifications

### MJML Workflow
- **Why not compile in browser?** MJML library is Node.js-only (uses file system APIs)
- **Current solution**: Export MJML files, users convert at mjml.io or via API
- **Future option**: Add backend service for server-side MJML compilation

## Next Planned Steps

### Phase 3: Testing & Simulation ‚úÖ COMPLETE

#### 1. Survey Testing Modal ‚úÖ COMPLETE

#### 2. Path Validation Warnings ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Warn users about configuration issues

**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ Real-time validation on path configuration changes
- ‚úÖ Warning badges showing total count at section header
- ‚úÖ Detailed warnings for each path with issues:
  - Paths with no routing logic configured
  - Impossible AND combinations (multiple radio options from same question)
  - Invalid score ranges (min > max)
  - Conflicting logic (advanced rules + simple mapping priority warning)
- ‚úÖ Yellow alert boxes with AlertTriangle icon
- ‚úÖ Helpful, actionable warning messages

**Files modified**:
- ‚úÖ `ContentPanel.jsx` - Validation state, useEffect, warning UI
- ‚úÖ Imports `validateAllPaths()` from `surveyLogic.js`

**Visual elements**:
- Yellow badge with warning count in section header
- Expandable warning panel for each problematic path
- Clean, non-intrusive styling that matches app design

**Status**: Fully functional with hot reload

#### 3. Campaign Flow Validation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Detect issues in overall campaign structure

**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive graph analysis with BFS traversal
- ‚úÖ Purple "Validate" button in TopBar
- ‚úÖ Right-side modal panel with results
- ‚úÖ Color-coded issues (Red=errors, Orange=warnings, Blue=info)
- ‚úÖ Detects all major structural issues:
  - Orphaned nodes (not connected to anything)
  - Unreachable nodes (no path from entry points)
  - Dead ends (no outgoing connections - marked as info)
  - Missing required content (empty subjects, no questions, etc.)
  - Disconnected survey paths
  - Multiple entry points (marked as info)

**Files created/modified**:
- ‚úÖ `utils/campaignValidation.js` - Graph analysis & validation logic
- ‚úÖ `components/ValidationPanel.jsx` - Results display modal
- ‚úÖ `App.jsx` - Validation state and handler
- ‚úÖ `TopBar.jsx` - Validate button (purple)

**Visual design**:
- Summary cards showing error/warning/info counts
- Grouped issues by severity
- Type badges (e.g., "Orphaned Node", "Missing Content")
- **Bold node labels + unique node IDs** for clear identification
- **Clickable issues** - Click any issue to open that node for editing
- Hover effects (scale + shadow) indicate interactivity
- Tooltip: "Click to open this node for editing"
- Auto-closes validation panel when issue clicked
- Empty state messages for perfect campaigns

**Status**: Fully functional with hot reload

### Phase 4: UX Polish & Professional Features

#### 1. Replace alert() with Toast Notifications ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Library**: react-hot-toast (lightweight, 14 alerts replaced)
**Changes**: All `alert()` calls replaced in:
- App.jsx (8 alerts) - Save, load, import, export, template operations
- ContentPanel.jsx (1 alert) - Node updates
- EmailEditorModal.jsx (3 alerts) - Template management
- exportUtils.js (2 alerts) - Export operations
**Features**:
- Success toasts: Green with checkmark icon
- Error toasts: Red with warning icon
- Auto-dismiss after 3-5 seconds
- Top-right positioning
- Non-blocking, can show multiple toasts
- Custom duration for longer messages (5s for MJML export instructions)

#### 2. Node Duplication ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Features**:
- Duplicate button in ContentPanel (green button between Save and Delete)
- Keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+D** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+D** (Mac)
- Deep clone of all node data including complex structures
- Smart ID regeneration for survey questions, options, paths, and rules
- Label automatically updated with "(Copy)" suffix
- Offset positioning (+50px x, +50px y) for easy identification
- Toast notification confirms duplication
- Works with all 5 node types
**Use case**: Quickly create similar emails or surveys without rebuilding from scratch
**Implementation**: 130-line duplicate function in App.jsx handles complex ID remapping for survey nodes

#### 3. Bulk Operations ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Features**:
- **Multi-select**: Shift+Drag to draw selection box around nodes (partial overlap selects)
- **Additive selection**: Shift+Click to add/remove nodes from current selection
- **Select all**: Ctrl+A or Cmd+A to select all nodes at once
- **Bulk duplication**: Duplicate multiple selected nodes with one keystroke (Ctrl+D)
- **Bulk deletion**: Delete key removes all selected nodes (built-in React Flow feature)
- **Visual feedback**: Bottom-left tooltip shows keyboard shortcuts and instructions
- **Smart positioning**: Duplicated nodes offset by +50px x/y for easy identification
**Implementation**:
- React Flow's built-in multi-select props (`selectionOnDrag`, `panOnDrag`, `selectionKeyCode="Shift"`)
- Pan still works with normal drag - selection requires Shift modifier
- Refactored handleDuplicateNode to check for multiple selected nodes
- Toast notifications confirm bulk actions (e.g., "3 nodes duplicated!")
**Use case**:
- Quickly duplicate multiple survey or email nodes for A/B testing variants
- Delete multiple test nodes at once during campaign cleanup
- Select entire campaign section for visual review

#### 4. Search & Filter ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Features**:

- **Clear filters**: X button to reset search and filter to defaults
- **Smart search**: Searches across multiple fields per node type

**Search Coverage by Node Type**:
- **All nodes**: Label, description
- **Email**: Subject (including A/B/C variants), email content
- **Survey**: Question text, response path labels
- **Conditional**: Condition text
- **Action**: Action type

**Visual Design**:
- Search input with magnifying glass icon
- Type filter dropdown (select element)
- Results count appears when filters active
- Clear button (X icon) removes all filters
- Smooth opacity transitions (0.2s ease)
- Centered in TopBar between left and right sections

**Implementation**:
- `nodeMatchesFilter()` callback checks search term and type
- Real-time filtering on every keystroke
- Case-insensitive search with `.toLowerCase()`
- Nodes mapped with opacity style based on match status
- Clear filters resets searchTerm to '' and nodeTypeFilter to 'all'

**Use cases**:
- Find specific email by subject line in large campaign
- Locate all survey nodes for review
- Search for nodes containing specific keywords
- Filter to show only conditional logic for debugging
- Quickly identify nodes needing attention

#### 5. Version History ‚úÖ COMPLETE (v0.7.0)

- Diff highlighting (show changes between versions)
- Auto-versioning on major changes

**Difficulty**: Medium (implemented in ~40 minutes)
**Status**: Fully functional and integrated

### Phase 5: Backend Integration (Optional)

#### 1. API Server
**Tech stack suggestions**:
- Express.js or Fastify (Node.js)
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storage
- JWT authentication

**Endpoints needed**:
- `POST /campaigns` - Save campaign
- `GET /campaigns/:id` - Load campaign
- `PUT /campaigns/:id` - Update campaign
- `DELETE /campaigns/:id` - Delete campaign
- `GET /campaigns` - List user's campaigns
- `POST /campaigns/:id/export` - Server-side MJML compilation

#### 2. MJML Compilation Service
**Purpose**: Convert MJML to HTML server-side
**Implementation**:
- Install `mjml` on backend (Node.js)
- Endpoint: `POST /mjml/compile`
- Input: MJML string
- Output: HTML string + any errors/warnings
- Replace export instructions with one-click HTML generation

#### 3. User Accounts & Sharing
**Features**:
- User registration/login
- Save campaigns to cloud
- Share campaigns with team (read-only or edit)
- Team templates library
- Role-based permissions

### Phase 6: Advanced Email Features

#### 1. Visual Email Template Builder
**Options** (from research):
- **Easy Email Editor** (open-source, MJML-based) - RECOMMENDED
- **Unlayer** (polished, paid plans for advanced features)
- **GrapeJS + MJML plugin** (maximum customization, more complex)

**Implementation approach**:
- Replace MJML code editor with drag-and-drop builder
- Keep existing template library as starting points
- Export both MJML and HTML
- See earlier conversation for detailed comparison

#### 2. Email Variables & Personalization
**Features**:
- Define campaign-level variables (firstName, company, etc.)
- Insert variables into email content with dropdown
- Preview with sample data
- Export variable mapping for ESP integration

#### 3. Enhance A/B Testing ‚úÖ PARTIAL (Subject lines complete, body variants pending)

- Map action nodes to CRM operations
- Export workflow as CRM automation

#### 3. Webhook Support
**Features**:
- Configure webhooks for events (survey completion, email open, etc.)
- Test webhook delivery
- Export webhook configuration

### Phase 8: Mobile Support

#### 1. Mobile Campaign Viewer (View-Only) ‚≠ê PLANNED
**Goal**: Enable sharing campaigns for mobile viewing without editing capability
**User Story**: "I'd like to be able to share a .json file via email and have someone be able to view and click around to see node contents even if they can't edit"

**Features**:
- **View-only mode**: Touch-friendly interface for viewing campaign flowcharts
- **Node inspection**: Tap nodes to view full content (emails, survey questions, logic)
- **Pan & zoom**: Touch gestures for navigation (pinch-to-zoom, two-finger pan)
- **JSON import**: Load campaign files shared via email/cloud
- **Responsive layout**: Optimized for phone and tablet screens
- **No editing**: All modification controls hidden in view-only mode
- **Share button**: Generate shareable links or QR codes (if backend added)

**Implementation Approach**:
1. **Easy Path** (Static export):
   - Generate standalone mobile-optimized HTML file
   - Include touch-friendly CSS and gestures
   - Single file can be emailed or hosted
   - No server required

2. **Medium Path** (Progressive Web App):
   - Add mobile viewport and touch handlers
   - Detect mobile device and switch to view-only mode
   - Service worker for offline viewing
   - Install as app on mobile home screen

3. **Advanced Path** (Dedicated mobile app):
   - React Native or Flutter companion app
   - Native file handling and sharing
   - Deep linking from email attachments
   - Push notifications for campaign updates

**Recommended**: Start with Easy Path (mobile-optimized HTML export), upgrade to PWA if adoption grows

**Difficulty**: Easy (mobile HTML export) / Medium (PWA with touch gestures) / Hard (native mobile app)

**Priority**: User-requested feature for campaign sharing and collaboration

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Features

1. **Start with data model** - Update default data in App.jsx `getDefaultDataForType()`
2. **Create/update node component** - Visual representation in `components/nodes/`
3. **Add editor UI** - Extend `ContentPanel.jsx` `renderNodeSpecificFields()`
4. **Update exports** - Ensure new data exports correctly in `exportUtils.js`
5. **Test save/load** - Verify localStorage roundtrip works
6. **Update this doc** - Keep claude.md current

### Code Style
- Use **functional components** with hooks (no class components)
- **Descriptive names**: `updateSurveyOption` not `updateOpt`
- **Extract complex logic** into utils/ functions
- **Comments for complex sections** (especially nested logic in ContentPanel)
- **Tailwind classes** in logical order: layout ‚Üí spacing ‚Üí colors ‚Üí typography

### Git Workflow (if/when added)
- Main branch: `main` (stable releases)
- Feature branches: `feature/survey-testing`, `feature/toast-notifications`
- Commit messages: Conventional commits format
  - `feat: Add survey testing modal`
  - `fix: Correct score calculation for checkbox questions`
  - `docs: Update claude.md with Phase 3 plans`

## Testing Checklist (Manual)

When making changes, verify:

- [ ] Can create all 5 node types
- [ ] Can connect nodes with edges
- [ ] Can edit node content in ContentPanel
- [ ] Can save campaign to localStorage
- [ ] Can load campaign from localStorage
- [ ] Can export as JSON
- [ ] Can import JSON file

- [ ] Advanced rules toggle works
- [ ] Visual/Code toggle in email editor works
- [ ] ReactQuill formatting persists on save
- [ ] MJML templates load correctly
- [ ] Template library campaigns load without errors

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance
- **Small campaigns** (<50 nodes): Instant, no issues
- **Medium campaigns** (50-200 nodes): Smooth, occasional re-render lag
- **Large campaigns** (200+ nodes): React Flow handles well, but ContentPanel can be slow

### Optimization Opportunities (Future)
1. **Memoize expensive calculations** - `calculateScoreRange()` in ContentPanel
2. **Virtualize long lists** - Response option lists in survey paths
3. **Debounce text inputs** - Reduce re-renders while typing
4. **Code-split routes** - If adding multi-page app
5. **React.memo on node components** - Prevent unnecessary re-renders

3. How many input/output handles?
4. What editor UI is needed in ContentPanel?
5. How should it export (JSON, HTML, etc.)?

### Adding New Survey Features?
1. Does it affect path routing logic?
2. Update `surveyLogic.js` evaluation functions?
3. Add visual indicators to SurveyNode?
4. Update export formats?
5. How to handle in validation?

### Adding Integrations?
1. Backend required or client-side?
2. API keys stored where (localStorage vs backend)?
3. Export format needed (JSON, CSV, API calls)?
4. Error handling strategy?
5. Rate limiting considerations?

## Deployment Considerations (Future)

### Static Hosting (Current - No Backend)
**Best options**:
- Vercel (recommended - zero config with Vite)
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- Cloudflare Pages

**Build command**: `npm run build`
**Output directory**: `dist/`

### Full-Stack Deployment (If Backend Added)
**Frontend**:
- Same as static hosting

**Backend options**:
- Railway, Render, Fly.io (Node.js)
- Vercel/Netlify Functions (serverless)
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk or ECS
- DigitalOcean App Platform

### Environment Variables
Currently none needed. Future variables:
- `VITE_API_URL` - Backend API endpoint
- `VITE_MJML_API_KEY` - MJML compilation service
- `VITE_ANALYTICS_ID` - Google Analytics, PostHog, etc.

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Blank page after loading
- **Cause**: Usually a JavaScript error in node rendering
- **Fix**: Check browser console, look for undefined data errors
- **Prevention**: Always provide default values in data models

**Issue**: "EBUSY: resource busy" warnings in Vite
- **Cause**: Windows/Dropbox file locking during HMR when cache is in synced folder
- **Impact**: Could cause 504 errors and white screen on load
- **Fix**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED in v0.2.1** - Vite cache now stored in system temp directory
  - Updated `vite.config.js` to use `path.join(tmpdir(), 'vite-cache-campaign')`
  - Cache location: `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Temp\vite-cache-campaign`
  - No longer conflicts with Dropbox sync
- **Legacy Fix**: If issue persists, move project outside Dropbox or disable sync temporarily

**Issue**: Survey paths not showing in node
- **Cause**: `responsePaths` array missing or empty in data
- **Fix**: Check that paths were created in ContentPanel
- **Prevention**: Default data in App.jsx should include at least 2 paths

**Issue**: WYSIWYG content not saving
- **Cause**: ReactQuill returns HTML string, might conflict with MJML
- **Fix**: Store in `emailContent` field (separate from `mjmlTemplate`)
- **Note**: Visual and Code modes share same data, changes sync immediately

### Debug Mode
To add debug logging (optional future feature):
1. Add `window.DEBUG = true` in browser console
2. Wrap console.logs: `if (window.DEBUG) console.log(...)`
3. Log critical data flow points:
   - Node creation
   - Path routing evaluation
   - Save/load operations
   - Export generation
