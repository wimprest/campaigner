## Current Features (Phase 2 & 3)

### 1. Flowchart Builder
- **Drag-and-drop** node creation from sidebar
- **5 node types**: Email, Survey, Conditional, Action, Delay
- **Visual connections** with colored paths and labels
- **Visual selection indicators** - Selected nodes display prominent colored ring, elevated shadow, and zoom effect for easy identification ‚≠ê NEW
- **Mini-map** for navigation of large campaigns
- **Pan & zoom** controls

### 2. Email Nodes
- **MJML template system** with 6 professional templates:
  - Blank, Welcome, Announcement, Survey, Promotional, Re-engagement
- **WYSIWYG editor** (ReactQuill) with Visual/Code toggle
- **Rich text formatting**: Headers, bold, italic, lists, colors, links, images
- **A/B/C Subject Line Testing** ‚≠ê NEW
  - Create 3 subject line variants (A, B, C)
  - Configure split percentages for each variant (default: 33/33/34%)
  - Color-coded tabbed interface (blue/green/purple)
  - Visual badge on nodes showing test status (e.g., "A/B/C Test 2/3")
  - Industry best practice: 1,500+ recipients per variant
- **Variable support**: `{{ firstName }}`, `{{ ctaLink }}`
- **Export formats**: MJML source, HTML (via external converter), metadata JSON

### 3. Survey Nodes (MOST COMPLEX)
- **Multi-question surveys** with collapsible UI
- **4 question types**: Radio (single choice), Checkbox (multiple), Text input, Numeric range
- **Response paths** with dynamic output handles
- **Conditional routing** with 4 methods:
  1. **Simple mapping**: Map specific options to paths
  2. **Score-based logic**: Assign points to options, route by total score
  3. **Numeric range routing**: Route based on numeric values (‚â§, ‚â•, =, between) ‚≠ê NEW
  4. **Advanced AND/OR/NOT rules**: Complex multi-option logic

#### Score-Based System
- Each response option has a `points` value (can be negative)
- Survey calculates min/max possible score range
- Paths have `scoreMin` and `scoreMax` thresholds
- Visual indicators: üéØ badge on nodes with score routing

#### Numeric Range Routing ‚≠ê NEW
- For numeric range questions only
- **4 operators**:
  - `‚â§` Less than or equal to (single value)
  - `‚â•` Greater than or equal to (single value)
  - `=` Equal to (single value)
  - `between` Range with min/max values
- **Use case example**: Route based on document volume
  - Path 1: response ‚â§ 100
  - Path 2: response between 101-500
  - Path 3: response ‚â• 501
- Live preview shows formatted conditions (e.g., "‚úì 101 - 500 ‚Üí Path 1")
- Multiple conditions per path supported

#### Advanced Logic Rules
- **AND logic**: Require ALL selected options
- **OR logic**: Require ANY of selected options
- **NOT logic**: Exclude if certain options selected
- Visual indicators: üß† badge on nodes with advanced rules
- Priority: Advanced rules > Numeric range routing > Score routing > Simple mapping

### 4. Save/Open/Export ‚≠ê REDESIGNED (Phase 4)
- **Traditional File-Based Save** - "Save" button downloads JSON file (like Photoshop, Word)
  - Downloads campaign as JSON file you can keep, email, backup
  - Replaces old localStorage save button
  - Full campaign data with metadata (version, timestamps, node counts)
- **Auto-Save Draft** - Silent background saving to browser localStorage
  - Auto-saves every 500ms after changes (debounced)
  - Auto-loads on app start - no manual "Load from Storage" needed
  - Crash protection - never lose work
  - "Draft saved" indicator shows status and timestamp
- **Open File** - Load campaigns from JSON files
  - "Open" menu (renamed from "Load") with file picker
  - Import saved JSON campaigns
  - Load campaign templates (Welcome Series, Satisfaction Survey, Re-engagement)
- **Export Options**: ‚≠ê ENHANCED (v0.5.0)
  - **Export Selection**: Export only selected nodes as JSON (perfect for sharing partial campaigns or creating templates)
  - **Email ZIP export**: MJML files, HTML placeholders, metadata JSON with comprehensive manifest
  - **Interactive HTML viewer**: Standalone HTML file with all campaign data
  - **All exports use readable timestamps**: `campaign_name_2025-10-25_13-45-30.json` instead of Unix timestamps
  - **Comprehensive manifest.json** in email exports listing all files and conversion instructions
- **Import Merge Options**: ‚≠ê NEW (v0.5.0)
  - When importing to a non-empty canvas, choose **Replace** (clear current) or **Append** (add to existing)
  - Append mode automatically offsets imported nodes to avoid overlap
  - ID remapping prevents conflicts when appending campaigns

### 5. User Experience & Feedback ‚≠ê PHASE 4
- **Toast Notifications** - Modern, non-blocking notification system (react-hot-toast)
  - Success toasts: Green with checkmark (save, load, export operations)
  - Error toasts: Red with warning icon (validation errors, missing data)
  - Auto-dismisses after 3-5 seconds
  - Positioned at top-right corner
  - No more blocking browser alert() dialogs!
- **Visual Selection Indicators** - Colored rings around selected nodes (Phase 3)
- **Validation Warnings** - Clickable issue cards that open nodes for editing (Phase 3)

### 6. Data Models

#### Survey Node Data Structure
```javascript
{
  label: "Survey Title",
  description: "Optional description",
  questions: [
    {
      id: "q_1234567890",
      text: "How satisfied are you?",
      questionType: "radio",  // radio | checkbox | text | range
      responseOptions: [
        {
          id: "q_1234567890_opt_1",
          text: "Very satisfied",
          points: 10
        },
        {
          id: "q_1234567890_opt_2",
          text: "Somewhat satisfied",
          points: 5
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  responsePaths: [
    {
      id: "path_1",
      label: "High Satisfaction",
      color: "#10b981",
      mappedOptions: ["q_1234567890_opt_1"],
      scoreMin: 8,
      scoreMax: 10,
      rangeConditions: [  // ‚≠ê NEW: For numeric range routing
        {
          id: "range_cond_1234567890",
          questionId: "q_1234567890",
          operator: "between",  // lte | gte | eq | between
          minValue: 101,
          maxValue: 500,
          value: null  // for single-value operators (lte, gte, eq)
        }
      ],
      advancedRules: {
        enabled: false,
        requireAll: [],   // AND logic
        requireAny: [],   // OR logic
        requireNone: []   // NOT logic
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Email Node Data Structure
```javascript
{
  label: "Welcome Email",
  subject: "Welcome to our platform!",  // Legacy single subject (backward compatible)
  subjectVariants: [  // ‚≠ê NEW: A/B/C testing
    {
      id: "A",
      subject: "Welcome to our platform!",
      weight: 33  // Percentage split
    },
    {
      id: "B",
      subject: "Get started with your new account",
      weight: 33
    },
    {
      id: "C",
      subject: "Your account is ready!",
      weight: 34
    }
  ],
  emailTemplate: "welcome",  // Template key
  mjmlTemplate: "<mjml>...</mjml>",  // MJML source code
  emailContent: "<p>Rich text content...</p>",  // HTML from ReactQuill
  description: "Optional description",
  notes: "Internal notes"
}
```

## Key Files & Their Roles

### `App.jsx` (500+ lines)
- **Purpose**: Main application component, state management, data model definitions
- **Responsibilities**:
  - React Flow setup and configuration
  - Node/edge state management
  - Drag-and-drop handlers
  - Default data structures for each node type
  - Save/load/import/export functions
- **Critical function**: `getDefaultDataForType()` - Defines initial data structure for new nodes

### `ContentPanel.jsx` (1400+ lines) ‚ö†Ô∏è MOST COMPLEX FILE
- **Purpose**: Right-side editing panel for all node types
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Render type-specific editors for each node
  - Survey question/option/path management
  - ReactQuill WYSIWYG integration
  - Email template selection with quick "Manage" button (line 320-327) ‚≠ê NEW
  - A/B/C subject line testing UI
  - Score calculation logic
  - Numeric range routing UI
  - Advanced rules UI (AND/OR/NOT)
  - Opens EmailEditorModal for full-screen editing
- **Key sections**:
  - Lines 1-220: State & helper functions (including new range condition helpers)
  - Lines 220-460: Email editor (MJML + ReactQuill + A/B testing + Manage button)
  - Lines 460-1040: Survey editor (questions, paths, scoring, range routing, advanced rules)
  - Lines 1040-1140: Other node editors (conditional, delay, action)
- **Tips for editing**:
  - Survey logic is highly nested - use collapsible sections
  - Score calculation happens in `calculateScoreRange()` function
  - Path mapping uses checkbox UI with `toggleOptionInPath()` function
  - Range conditions managed via `addRangeCondition()`, `updateRangeCondition()`, `removeRangeCondition()`
  - Template management accessible via inline "Manage" button or "Expand Editor" button

### `utils/surveyLogic.js` (NEW - Phase 2)
- **Purpose**: Survey response evaluation engine
- **Functions**:
  - `calculateTotalScore()` - Sum points from selected options
  - `matchesScoreThreshold()` - Check if score falls in range
  - `evaluateAdvancedRules()` - Evaluate AND/OR/NOT logic
  - `determineResponsePath()` - Main routing function (priority order)
  - `validatePathConfiguration()` - Detect configuration issues

### `utils/exportUtils.js`
- **Purpose**: All export functionality
- **Functions**:
  - `exportCampaignJSON()` - Full campaign export with metadata
  - `exportAllEmailsAsZip()` - MJML + HTML + metadata ZIP
  - `exportAsInteractiveHTML()` - Standalone viewer
  - `generateBasicMJML()` - Convert plain text to MJML
- **Important**: MJML compilation happens externally (mjml.io or API), not in browser

### `EmailEditorModal.jsx` (NEW - Phase 2)
- **Purpose**: Full-screen modal for email editing and template management
- **Features**:
  - Full-screen WYSIWYG email editor
  - Visual/Code toggle for MJML editing
  - Template manager with CRUD operations (line 256-268, 396-619)
  - Create, edit, delete custom templates

### `SurveyNode.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Visual representation of survey nodes in flowchart
- **Features**:
  - Shows first question preview
  - Displays all response paths with colors
  - Dynamic output handles (one per path)
  - Visual badges: üéØ for score routing, üß† for advanced rules
  - Handle positioning calculated by `getHandlePosition()`
  - Green ring selection indicator when node is being edited

### Node Components (EmailNode, ConditionalNode, ActionNode, DelayNode) ‚≠ê PHASE 3 UX
- **Visual Selection Indicators**: All 5 custom node components now display prominent visual feedback when selected
- **Implementation**: Uses React Flow's `selected` prop (automatically passed to custom nodes)
- **Styling**: Each node type uses its own thematic color for selection effects:
  - EmailNode: Blue ring (`ring-blue-500`)
  - SurveyNode: Green ring (`ring-green-500`)
  - ConditionalNode: Purple ring (`ring-purple-500`)
  - ActionNode: Orange ring (`ring-orange-500`)
  - DelayNode: Red ring (`ring-red-500`)
- **Effects applied**:
  - `ring-8 ring-{color}-500 ring-opacity-75` - Prominent colored ring around node (doubled thickness, increased opacity for better visibility)
  - `shadow-2xl` - Strong elevated shadow for clear depth perception
  - `scale-105` - 5% zoom effect
  - `transition-all` - Smooth transitions between states
- **Use case**: Makes it immediately obvious which node is being edited in ContentPanel, especially useful for:
  - Large campaigns with many nodes
  - When clicking validation issues that open nodes for editing
  - Quick visual feedback during node navigation

## Development Patterns & Conventions

### State Management
- **Local component state** (useState) for UI interactions
- **React Flow hooks** (useNodesState, useEdgesState) for flowchart data
- **localStorage** for persistence (no backend/database)
- **No global state library** (Redux, Zustand, etc.) - keeping it simple

### Data Flow
1. User drags node from Sidebar ‚Üí `onDrop` in App.jsx
2. New node created with default data ‚Üí `getDefaultDataForType()`
3. User clicks node ‚Üí `onNodeClick` sets `selectedNode` state
4. ContentPanel renders with node data ‚Üí `renderNodeSpecificFields()`
5. User edits in ContentPanel ‚Üí local state (`localData`)
6. User clicks Save ‚Üí `onUpdate()` callback updates App.jsx state
7. React Flow automatically persists visual changes (position, connections)

### ID Generation
- Nodes: `node_${id++}` (simple incrementing counter)
- Questions: `q_${Date.now()}` (timestamp-based)
- Options: `q_${questionId}_opt_${Date.now()}` (prefixed with question ID)
- Paths: `path_${Date.now()}` (timestamp-based)

**Why timestamps?** Ensures uniqueness even when adding/removing items rapidly.

### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind utility classes** for 95% of styling
- **Inline styles** for dynamic colors (path colors, badges)
- **CSS modules**: None - all Tailwind or inline
- **Global CSS**: Only for ReactQuill (imported from node_modules)

### Error Handling
- **Minimal error boundaries** - relying on React defaults
- **Validation**: Mostly UI-level (required fields, number inputs)
- **User feedback**: `alert()` for save confirmations (TODO: replace with toast notifications)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Issues
1. ~~**Vite EBUSY warnings** on Windows/Dropbox~~ - **FIXED** (v0.2.1): Cache moved to system temp directory
2. **No toast notifications** - using browser `alert()` (works but not polished)
3. **No undo/redo** - users must manually save versions
4. **No collaborative editing** - single user, localStorage only

### Technical Debt
1. **ContentPanel.jsx is too large** (~1500 lines) - should split into sub-components
2. **No TypeScript** - would help catch data structure errors
3. **Limited accessibility** - keyboard navigation not fully implemented
4. **No unit tests** - relying on manual testing
5. **Alert() for user feedback** - should replace with toast notifications

### MJML Workflow
- **Why not compile in browser?** MJML library is Node.js-only (uses file system APIs)
- **Current solution**: Export MJML files, users convert at mjml.io or via API
- **Future option**: Add backend service for server-side MJML compilation

## Next Planned Steps

### Phase 3: Testing & Simulation ‚úÖ COMPLETE

#### 1. Survey Testing Modal ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Let users simulate survey responses and see which path would be taken

**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ "Test Survey" button in ContentPanel for survey nodes
- ‚úÖ Full-screen modal dialog showing all questions
- ‚úÖ Interactive question inputs (radio, checkbox, text, range)
- ‚úÖ Real-time path evaluation and highlighting
- ‚úÖ Score calculation display
- ‚úÖ "Additional Details" panel for "Other" text responses
- ‚úÖ All path evaluation results with match reasons

**Files created/modified**:
- ‚úÖ `ContentPanel.jsx` - Test button and modal integration
- ‚úÖ `components/SurveyTestModal.jsx` - Complete testing interface
- ‚úÖ Uses `simulateSurveyCompletion()` from `surveyLogic.js`

**Status**: Fully functional with hot reload

#### 2. Path Validation Warnings ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Warn users about configuration issues

**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ Real-time validation on path configuration changes
- ‚úÖ Warning badges showing total count at section header
- ‚úÖ Detailed warnings for each path with issues:
  - Paths with no routing logic configured
  - Impossible AND combinations (multiple radio options from same question)
  - Invalid score ranges (min > max)
  - Conflicting logic (advanced rules + simple mapping priority warning)
- ‚úÖ Yellow alert boxes with AlertTriangle icon
- ‚úÖ Helpful, actionable warning messages

**Files modified**:
- ‚úÖ `ContentPanel.jsx` - Validation state, useEffect, warning UI
- ‚úÖ Imports `validateAllPaths()` from `surveyLogic.js`

**Visual elements**:
- Yellow badge with warning count in section header
- Expandable warning panel for each problematic path
- Clean, non-intrusive styling that matches app design

**Status**: Fully functional with hot reload

#### 3. Campaign Flow Validation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Detect issues in overall campaign structure

**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive graph analysis with BFS traversal
- ‚úÖ Purple "Validate" button in TopBar
- ‚úÖ Right-side modal panel with results
- ‚úÖ Color-coded issues (Red=errors, Orange=warnings, Blue=info)
- ‚úÖ Detects all major structural issues:
  - Orphaned nodes (not connected to anything)
  - Unreachable nodes (no path from entry points)
  - Dead ends (no outgoing connections - marked as info)
  - Missing required content (empty subjects, no questions, etc.)
  - Disconnected survey paths
  - Multiple entry points (marked as info)

**Files created/modified**:
- ‚úÖ `utils/campaignValidation.js` - Graph analysis & validation logic
- ‚úÖ `components/ValidationPanel.jsx` - Results display modal
- ‚úÖ `App.jsx` - Validation state and handler
- ‚úÖ `TopBar.jsx` - Validate button (purple)

**Visual design**:
- Summary cards showing error/warning/info counts
- Grouped issues by severity
- Type badges (e.g., "Orphaned Node", "Missing Content")
- **Bold node labels + unique node IDs** for clear identification
- **Clickable issues** - Click any issue to open that node for editing
- Hover effects (scale + shadow) indicate interactivity
- Tooltip: "Click to open this node for editing"
- Auto-closes validation panel when issue clicked
- Empty state messages for perfect campaigns

**Status**: Fully functional with hot reload

### Phase 4: UX Polish & Professional Features

#### 1. Replace alert() with Toast Notifications ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Library**: react-hot-toast (lightweight, 14 alerts replaced)
**Changes**: All `alert()` calls replaced in:
- App.jsx (8 alerts) - Save, load, import, export, template operations
- ContentPanel.jsx (1 alert) - Node updates
- EmailEditorModal.jsx (3 alerts) - Template management
- exportUtils.js (2 alerts) - Export operations
**Features**:
- Success toasts: Green with checkmark icon
- Error toasts: Red with warning icon
- Auto-dismiss after 3-5 seconds
- Top-right positioning
- Non-blocking, can show multiple toasts
- Custom duration for longer messages (5s for MJML export instructions)

#### 2. Node Duplication ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Features**:
- Duplicate button in ContentPanel (green button between Save and Delete)
- Keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+D** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+D** (Mac)
- Deep clone of all node data including complex structures
- Smart ID regeneration for survey questions, options, paths, and rules
- Label automatically updated with "(Copy)" suffix
- Offset positioning (+50px x, +50px y) for easy identification
- Toast notification confirms duplication
- Works with all 5 node types
**Use case**: Quickly create similar emails or surveys without rebuilding from scratch
**Implementation**: 130-line duplicate function in App.jsx handles complex ID remapping for survey nodes

#### 3. Bulk Operations ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Features**:
- **Multi-select**: Shift+Drag to draw selection box around nodes (partial overlap selects)
- **Additive selection**: Shift+Click to add/remove nodes from current selection
- **Select all**: Ctrl+A or Cmd+A to select all nodes at once
- **Bulk duplication**: Duplicate multiple selected nodes with one keystroke (Ctrl+D)
- **Bulk deletion**: Delete key removes all selected nodes (built-in React Flow feature)
- **Visual feedback**: Bottom-left tooltip shows keyboard shortcuts and instructions
- **Smart positioning**: Duplicated nodes offset by +50px x/y for easy identification
**Implementation**:
- React Flow's built-in multi-select props (`selectionOnDrag`, `panOnDrag`, `selectionKeyCode="Shift"`)
- Pan still works with normal drag - selection requires Shift modifier
- Refactored handleDuplicateNode to check for multiple selected nodes
- Toast notifications confirm bulk actions (e.g., "3 nodes duplicated!")
**Use case**:
- Quickly duplicate multiple survey or email nodes for A/B testing variants
- Delete multiple test nodes at once during campaign cleanup
- Select entire campaign section for visual review

#### 4. Search & Filter ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Features**:
- **Search bar**: Text input in TopBar to search across all node content

- **Visual highlighting**: Non-matching nodes dimmed to 20% opacity with smooth transition
- **Results counter**: Shows "X of Y" nodes matching current filters
- **Clear filters**: X button to reset search and filter to defaults
- **Smart search**: Searches across multiple fields per node type

**Search Coverage by Node Type**:
- **All nodes**: Label, description
- **Email**: Subject (including A/B/C variants), email content
- **Survey**: Question text, response path labels
- **Conditional**: Condition text
- **Action**: Action type

**Visual Design**:
- Search input with magnifying glass icon
- Type filter dropdown (select element)
- Results count appears when filters active
- Clear button (X icon) removes all filters
- Smooth opacity transitions (0.2s ease)
- Centered in TopBar between left and right sections

**Implementation**:
- `nodeMatchesFilter()` callback checks search term and type
- Real-time filtering on every keystroke
- Case-insensitive search with `.toLowerCase()`
- Nodes mapped with opacity style based on match status
- Clear filters resets searchTerm to '' and nodeTypeFilter to 'all'

**Use cases**:
- Find specific email by subject line in large campaign
- Locate all survey nodes for review
- Search for nodes containing specific keywords
- Filter to show only conditional logic for debugging
- Quickly identify nodes needing attention

#### 5. Version History
**Features**:
- Save multiple versions in localStorage

**Options** (from research):
- **Easy Email Editor** (open-source, MJML-based) - RECOMMENDED
- **Unlayer** (polished, paid plans for advanced features)
- **GrapeJS + MJML plugin** (maximum customization, more complex)

**Implementation approach**:
- Replace MJML code editor with drag-and-drop builder
- Keep existing template library as starting points
- Export both MJML and HTML
- See earlier conversation for detailed comparison

#### 2. Email Variables & Personalization
**Features**:
- Define campaign-level variables (firstName, company, etc.)

### Phase 7: Integration Capabilities

#### 1. ESP Connectors
**Target platforms**:
- Mailchimp, SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES
- Export in platform-specific formats
- API key configuration (if backend added)

#### 2. CRM Integration
**Platforms**:
- HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive
- Map action nodes to CRM operations
- Export workflow as CRM automation

#### 3. Webhook Support
**Features**:
- Configure webhooks for events (survey completion, email open, etc.)
- Test webhook delivery
- Export webhook configuration

### Phase 8: Mobile Support

#### 1. Mobile Campaign Viewer (View-Only) ‚≠ê PLANNED
**Goal**: Enable sharing campaigns for mobile viewing without editing capability
**User Story**: "I'd like to be able to share a .json file via email and have someone be able to view and click around to see node contents even if they can't edit"

**Features**:
- **View-only mode**: Touch-friendly interface for viewing campaign flowcharts
- **Node inspection**: Tap nodes to view full content (emails, survey questions, logic)
- **Pan & zoom**: Touch gestures for navigation (pinch-to-zoom, two-finger pan)
- **JSON import**: Load campaign files shared via email/cloud
- **Responsive layout**: Optimized for phone and tablet screens
- **No editing**: All modification controls hidden in view-only mode
- **Share button**: Generate shareable links or QR codes (if backend added)

**Implementation Approach**:
1. **Easy Path** (Static export):
   - Generate standalone mobile-optimized HTML file
   - Include touch-friendly CSS and gestures
   - Single file can be emailed or hosted
   - No server required

2. **Medium Path** (Progressive Web App):
   - Add mobile viewport and touch handlers
   - Detect mobile device and switch to view-only mode
   - Service worker for offline viewing
   - Install as app on mobile home screen

3. **Advanced Path** (Dedicated mobile app):
   - React Native or Flutter companion app
   - Native file handling and sharing
   - Deep linking from email attachments
   - Push notifications for campaign updates

**Recommended**: Start with Easy Path (mobile-optimized HTML export), upgrade to PWA if adoption grows

**Difficulty**: Easy (mobile HTML export) / Medium (PWA with touch gestures) / Hard (native mobile app)

**Priority**: User-requested feature for campaign sharing and collaboration

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Features

1. **Start with data model** - Update default data in App.jsx `getDefaultDataForType()`
2. **Create/update node component** - Visual representation in `components/nodes/`
3. **Add editor UI** - Extend `ContentPanel.jsx` `renderNodeSpecificFields()`
4. **Update exports** - Ensure new data exports correctly in `exportUtils.js`
5. **Test save/load** - Verify localStorage roundtrip works
6. **Update this doc** - Keep claude.md current

### Code Style
- Use **functional components** with hooks (no class components)
- **Descriptive names**: `updateSurveyOption` not `updateOpt`
- **Extract complex logic** into utils/ functions
- **Comments for complex sections** (especially nested logic in ContentPanel)
- **Tailwind classes** in logical order: layout ‚Üí spacing ‚Üí colors ‚Üí typography

### Git Workflow (if/when added)
- Main branch: `main` (stable releases)
- Feature branches: `feature/survey-testing`, `feature/toast-notifications`
- Commit messages: Conventional commits format
  - `feat: Add survey testing modal`
  - `fix: Correct score calculation for checkbox questions`
  - `docs: Update claude.md with Phase 3 plans`

## Testing Checklist (Manual)

When making changes, verify:

- [ ] Can create all 5 node types
- [ ] Can connect nodes with edges
- [ ] Can edit node content in ContentPanel
- [ ] Can save campaign to localStorage
- [ ] Can load campaign from localStorage
- [ ] Can export as JSON
- [ ] Can import JSON file
- [ ] Can export emails as ZIP
- [ ] Can export as interactive HTML
- [ ] Survey nodes show correct number of output handles
- [ ] Score calculation updates when changing points
- [ ] Advanced rules toggle works
- [ ] Visual/Code toggle in email editor works
- [ ] ReactQuill formatting persists on save
- [ ] MJML templates load correctly
- [ ] Template library campaigns load without errors

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance
- **Small campaigns** (<50 nodes): Instant, no issues
- **Medium campaigns** (50-200 nodes): Smooth, occasional re-render lag
- **Large campaigns** (200+ nodes): React Flow handles well, but ContentPanel can be slow

### Optimization Opportunities (Future)
1. **Memoize expensive calculations** - `calculateScoreRange()` in ContentPanel
2. **Virtualize long lists** - Response option lists in survey paths
3. **Debounce text inputs** - Reduce re-renders while typing
4. **Code-split routes** - If adding multi-page app
5. **React.memo on node components** - Prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Questions to Ask When Extending

### Adding New Node Types?
1. What data does it need to store?
2. What visual representation makes sense?
3. How many input/output handles?
4. What editor UI is needed in ContentPanel?
5. How should it export (JSON, HTML, etc.)?

### Adding New Survey Features?
1. Does it affect path routing logic?
2. Update `surveyLogic.js` evaluation functions?
3. Add visual indicators to SurveyNode?
4. Update export formats?
5. How to handle in validation?

### Adding Integrations?
1. Backend required or client-side?
2. API keys stored where (localStorage vs backend)?
3. Export format needed (JSON, CSV, API calls)?
4. Error handling strategy?
5. Rate limiting considerations?

## Deployment Considerations (Future)

### Static Hosting (Current - No Backend)
**Best options**:
- Vercel (recommended - zero config with Vite)
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- Cloudflare Pages

**Build command**: `npm run build`
**Output directory**: `dist/`

### Full-Stack Deployment (If Backend Added)
**Frontend**:
- Same as static hosting

**Backend options**:
- Railway, Render, Fly.io (Node.js)
- Vercel/Netlify Functions (serverless)
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk or ECS
- DigitalOcean App Platform

### Environment Variables
Currently none needed. Future variables:
- `VITE_API_URL` - Backend API endpoint
- `VITE_MJML_API_KEY` - MJML compilation service
- `VITE_ANALYTICS_ID` - Google Analytics, PostHog, etc.

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Blank page after loading
- **Cause**: Usually a JavaScript error in node rendering
- **Fix**: Check browser console, look for undefined data errors
- **Prevention**: Always provide default values in data models

**Issue**: "EBUSY: resource busy" warnings in Vite
- **Cause**: Windows/Dropbox file locking during HMR when cache is in synced folder
- **Impact**: Could cause 504 errors and white screen on load
- **Fix**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED in v0.2.1** - Vite cache now stored in system temp directory
  - Updated `vite.config.js` to use `path.join(tmpdir(), 'vite-cache-campaign')`
  - Cache location: `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Temp\vite-cache-campaign`
  - No longer conflicts with Dropbox sync
- **Legacy Fix**: If issue persists, move project outside Dropbox or disable sync temporarily

**Issue**: Survey paths not showing in node
- **Cause**: `responsePaths` array missing or empty in data
- **Fix**: Check that paths were created in ContentPanel
- **Prevention**: Default data in App.jsx should include at least 2 paths

**Issue**: WYSIWYG content not saving
- **Cause**: ReactQuill returns HTML string, might conflict with MJML
- **Fix**: Store in `emailContent` field (separate from `mjmlTemplate`)
- **Note**: Visual and Code modes share same data, changes sync immediately

### Debug Mode
To add debug logging (optional future feature):
1. Add `window.DEBUG = true` in browser console
2. Wrap console.logs: `if (window.DEBUG) console.log(...)`
3. Log critical data flow points:
   - Node creation
   - Path routing evaluation
   - Save/load operations
   - Export generation

## Quick Start for New Developers

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000

# Try these actions:
1. Drag an Email node from sidebar to canvas
2. Click the node to open ContentPanel
3. Try the Visual/Code toggle in email content
4. Drag a Survey node
5. Click Survey node, add questions and paths
6. Try score-based routing or advanced logic
7. Connect nodes by dragging from output to input handles
8. Save campaign (top bar)
9. Export as HTML to see standalone viewer
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **ContentPanel.jsx is the brain** - Most complex logic lives here (~1500+ lines)
2. **Survey logic is 3-tiered** - Simple mapping, score-based, advanced rules (priority order)
3. **MJML stays as code** - No browser compilation, export for external conversion
4. **localStorage is single source of truth** - No backend (yet)
5. **ReactQuill handles WYSIWYG** - Already installed and working
6. **surveyLogic.js fully integrated** - Evaluation engine powers testing modal and validation warnings
7. **campaignValidation.js for graph analysis** - BFS traversal, orphaned nodes, unreachable paths
8. **Triple validation system** - Survey paths + Unmapped options + Campaign structure
9. **Phase 3 complete** - Testing, validation, and quality assurance features all working
10. **Next focus: Phase 4 UX polish** - Toast notifications, node duplication, search & filter
